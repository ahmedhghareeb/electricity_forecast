# Deploy and Electricity Forecasting Model from R 
This repository describes the code used in [this blog post](http://www.dukeanalytics.com/blog/electricity-forecasting-the-power-of-r-in-a-spreadsheet/)

The model is fitted using UK National grid data combined with daily weather data from the London area.
The model is built to illustrate how its possible to easily make forecasts from Excel using models built in R using the [Duke Analytics model deployment API](http://www.dukeanalytics.com/products/dukedeploy.php).
